Can you tell me about your main responsibilities in your current role?\\nuser: Hi! Sure, I mostly develop backend APIs using Python and FastAPI, and occasionally work on frontend features with Next.js. I also write unit tests and help maintain CI/CD pipelines.\\nassistant: Great. What projects have you worked on recently that you\\'re proud of?\\nuser: I recently contributed to a project called \\'Coworking AI Assistant\\' where I implemented API endpoints and integrated some AI-powered automation features. I also worked on a small resume parsing tool to help recruiters extract candidate info faster.\\nassistant: Nice! How would you describe your strengths and areas for improvement?\\nuser: I\\'m very good at designing scalable APIs and quickly adapting to complex problems. I\\'d like to get better at Rust and low-level system optimization.\\nassistant: And what motivates you in your work?\\nuser: I enjoy building AI-driven tools that make workflows smarter and more efficient. Generative AI is especially exciting for me.\\nassistant: Finally, are there any other technical skills or tools you use that we haven\\'t mentioned?\\nuser: I also work with PostgreSQL and Docker, and I sometimes use React for frontend prototypes.\\nassistant: That\\'s helpful. Could you tell me more about your experience with databases and cloud technologies?\\nuser: I\\'ve worked with PostgreSQL for data modeling and writing optimized queries. I also have experience with AWS services like EC2 for deployment and S3 for file storage in my projects.\\nassistant: What about testing methodologies? What\\'s your experience there?\\nuser: I regularly write unit tests with pytest for backend services and use Jest for frontend testing. I\\'m also familiar with integration testing and have worked with GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.\\nassistant: Are there any other frontend frameworks or tools you\\'re comfortable with besides Next.js?\\nuser: Yes, I have experience with React as I mentioned, and I\\'ve also used Vue.js in previous projects. For state management, I\\'m familiar with Redux and Context API.</Current Conversation>\\n'}]\n",

For example, with a token bucket, I’d replenish tokens at a fixed rate using Lua scripts to make the operation atomic—ensuring consistency across multiple API instances. For the sliding window, I’d store recent request timestamps in a sorted set and trim old entries on each request. Both strategies scale well horizontally, and Redis makes it easy to expire keys automatically, keeping memory usage in check.\n",

Looking forward to hearing your approach!\\nuser: Uh, I’d probably just use JWTs for login and maybe add some roles in the database. For rate limiting, I think I’d just add something to block too many requests, and caching—I’m not really sure, maybe use Redis or something. I haven’t really done all of that together before.\\nassistant: That’s a solid starting point, Salim. Let’s dig a bit deeper into the rate‑limiting aspect.\\n\\n**Follow‑up Question:**  \\n*Which algorithm or strategy would you choose for rate limiting (e.g., token bucket, leaky bucket, fixed window, sliding window) and how would you implement it in a distributed environment using Redis or another shared store?*\\nuser: I’d go with the sliding window or token bucket algorithm since they provide smoother request handling compared to a fixed window.

In a distributed setup, I’d use Redis as the shared state store. Each user or API key would have a Redis key tracking timestamps or tokens. For example, with a token bucket, I’d replenish tokens at a fixed rate using Lua scripts to make the operation atomic—ensuring consistency across multiple API instances. For the sliding window, I’d store recent request timestamps in a sorted set and trim old entries on each request. Both strategies scale well horizontally, and Redis makes it easy to expire keys automatically, keeping memory usage in check.'},\n",
