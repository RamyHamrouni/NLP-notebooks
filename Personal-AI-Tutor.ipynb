            "A *variable* is simply a name that refers to a value stored in memory. In Python you don’t have to declare the type of a variable beforehand – you just assign a value to a name, and Python figures out the type automatically.\n",

Python variables can hold various data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, tuples and lists: Variables can be used in various operations, which allows us to transform them mathematically (if they are numbers), change their string values through operations like concatenation, and compare values using equality operators.
